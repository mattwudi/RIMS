# RIMS

RIMS is straightforward and easy way to manage your dealership's loaner fleet. Intended to make the process of creating loaner agreements quick and easy, RIMS will allow you store customer information for easy look ups with returning customers, look up information regarding the usage history of vehicles in your fleet, and add or remove vehicles from your fleet quickly. This is intended to streamline a process that you may currently be doing by hand.

RIMS is created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Node.js and express as our major frameworks.

# Usage - Process 

## 1.Home

A basic overview of the vehicle availabilty, as well as the most recent rentals. The dropdown featured on this page allows you to filter by vehicle status. 

## 2.Fleet Modification 

This is a basic control interface for the vehicle fleet. You may edit, delete, or add a vehicle to your table. 

## 3.Customers

Similarly to the fleet page, this page allows you to search for current customers, or add a new one. 

## 4.Open Agreement 

A form to initiate a rental agreement. By filling in the needed information and choosing from the available vehicles, a record that a vehicle has been taken out is created. 

## 5.Return Agreement

This page looks at vehicles that are currently loaned out, and lets you input the returned miles to mark its return, or whether the vehicle is decommissioned. 

## 6.History

This page returns any agreements tied to the customer's name you are searching. Inputting nothing returns the current running list of agreements. Using the clear history button removes the queries from the page.
