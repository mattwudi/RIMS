# RIMS

RIMS is straightforward and easy way to manage your dealership's loaner fleet. Intended to make the process of creating loaner agreements quick and easy, RIMS will allow you store customer information for easy look ups with returning customers, look up information regarding the usage history of vehicles in your fleet, and add or remove vehicles from your fleet quickly. This is intended to streamline a process that you may currently be doing by hand.

RIMS is created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Node.js and express as our major frameworks.
